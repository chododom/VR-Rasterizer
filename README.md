Project 1 of CSC 385 (Computer Graphics) at Union College, NY, USA.
The goal was to perform analysis of different VR machines and apps (Part 1), answer some general questions (Part 2) and finally
implement a line and polygon rasterizer in VR along with flood filling algorithm (Part 3).

Javascript and THREE JS were used to implement the practical part of the project.
